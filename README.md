## [Motivation] <a name="motiv"></a>

Coding and developemnet is so dynamic and evolving rapidly. New languages are emerging and new tools are developed. It may not be easy to interprete where it is heading without having a feedback. This project is analysing the current and recent years trends. For this purpose, [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) survey data is used. The results could provide a glance of fascinating tools used by developers of varying expertie level. It could be used as guidance for newbies or hobbiests. Knowing the trends could also assist junior developers, educators, and even professionals to prepare for uprising technologies in programming languages, databases, frameworks and platforms.

## Files<a name="files"></a>

The main file that has all python code is **_'main.ipynb'_** in root directory.<br/>
__Data__ files are __*csv*__ format which are to be downloaded from [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).<br/>
Each survey from 2017 until 2020 has a file named _survey_results_public.csv_ which should be located in its directory with specified tree structure.<br/>
The final path in data directory, for 2017 survey for instance, would be as follows:
_'./data/2017/survey_results_public.csv'_<br/>
